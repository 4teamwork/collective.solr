TODOs:
* tests for maintenance view for syncing catalog and solr indexes
* support for order, limit etc parameters
* remove temporary fix for issue with ex-persistent utility again
* result iterator (with __len__ on results object)
* batch support for searching

* provide decorator for solr exceptions
* add signal handlers (see store.py)
* add a configurable queue limit for large transactions
* mapping from accessor name to attribute name, i.e. getTitle -> title,
  preferably via <copyField> tags in the solr schema
* evaluate http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/solr.py as a replacement
