TODOs:
* remove temporary fix for issue with ex-persistent utility again
* support boolean attributes
* support path searches (i.e. translate "range")
* gracefully handle error cause by 404s (and the search triggered by it)
* result iterator (with __len__ on results object)
* support for order, limit etc parameters

* provide decorator for solr exceptions
* add signal handlers (see store.py)
* what about http timeouts?
* add a configurable queue limit for large transactions
* mapping from accessor name to attribute name, i.e. getTitle -> title,
  preferably via <copyField> tags in the solr schema
