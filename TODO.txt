* browsertest for indexing

* design and hook up searching
* provide decorator for solr exceptions
* error handling for stale connections
* add signal handlers (see store.py)
* what about http timeouts?
* genericsetup support for configuration
* add a configurable queue limit for large transactions
* mapping from accessor name to attribute name, i.e. getTitle -> title,
  preferably via <copyField> tags in the solr schema
