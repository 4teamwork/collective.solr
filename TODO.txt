* browsertest for indexing
* browser view for reindexing
* move caching of schema to `solr.py`
* implement on/off switch and configlet
* error handling for stale connections
* provide decorator for solr exceptions
* what about http timeouts?
* design and hook up searching
* add a configurable queue limit for large transactions
* mapping from accessor name to attribute name, i.e. getTitle -> title,
